# Deployment

This bot is small and stateless. It runs anywhere Node 20 runs: Fly.io, Railway, Render, a VPS, a Docker container, or your laptop. There is no database, no migrations, no volume to mount. A redeploy is the whole release process.

## What you need

1. A Telegram bot from `@BotFather`. Save the token.
2. A Telegram channel where the bot is an admin with **Post messages** permission. No other right is required.
3. The channel id. Easiest path: forward a channel message to `@RawDataBot` or `@JsonDumpBot` and read `chat.id`. It looks like `-1001234567890`. The numeric id is preferred; it survives a username change.

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Required | Notes                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BOT_TOKEN`          | yes      | From `@BotFather`.                                          |
| `CHANNEL_CHAT_ID`    | yes      | Numeric `-100...` is best; `@channel` also works.           |
| `CHANNEL_PUBLIC_URL` | no       | Public link shown by `/start` in DMs.                       |
| `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`  | no       | Unlocks `/admin_easy` and `/admin_hard` in DMs.             |
| `TZ_NAME`            | no       | Cron timezone. Default UTC; the example sets Africa/Cairo.  |
| `EASY_CRON`          | no       | Override the easy schedule cron (default `0 10 * * *`).     |
| `HARD_CRON`          | no       | Override the hard schedule cron (default `0 19 * * *`).     |
| `PORT`               | no       | `/health` server port. Default 8080.                        |
| `NODE_ENV`           | no       | `production` for hosted.                                    |

The `.env` file is optional. If you set the variables in your host's dashboard, you do not need a file at all.

## First post: the pinned welcome

Once the bot is up and is a channel admin, run:

```bash
pnpm post-welcome
```

The bot will post the welcome message and print the message id. Open the channel, long-press the welcome, and pin it. To edit later in place (the pin stays, no notification fires):

```bash
pnpm post-welcome <message_id>
```

## Smoke test the schedules

```bash
pnpm send-test easy     # fires today's easy question to the channel right now
pnpm send-test hard     # fires today's hard question
pnpm send-test both
```

The script preflights `getChat` first, so if the token is wrong or the channel id is bad, you get one clean error instead of two confusing ones.

## Hosting recipes

### Fly.io

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy             # answer the prompts; pick a region near your audience
fly secrets set BOT_TOKEN=... CHANNEL_CHAT_ID=... TZ_NAME=Africa/Cairo
fly deploy
fly logs
```

Set `[processes] app = "node node_modules/.bin/tsx src/index.ts"` or compile first and run `node dist/index.js`. The `/health` endpoint on port 8080 keeps the dyno alive.

### Railway

1. Create a new project from this repo.
2. Add the env vars in the dashboard.
3. Set the start command to `pnpm start` (or `pnpm dev` for hot reload, not recommended in prod).
4. Done.

### Plain VPS

```bash
pnpm install --prod
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Wrap it in a systemd unit or pm2 so it restarts on crash. Set the env vars in the unit file or in a `.env` next to the binary.

### Docker

A minimal Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
RUN corepack enable && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile || pnpm install
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "--import", "tsx", "dist/index.js"]
```

The image is a few hundred MB. There is nothing to mount; logs go to stdout.

## Verifying it works

1. Check `/health` returns 200 with `{"ok":true,"schedules":2,...}`.
2. Tail the logs for `Schedule registered` lines at startup.
3. Send `/start` to the bot in DM; you should get a welcome reply pointing at the channel.
4. Use `pnpm send-test easy` to verify the channel post end to end.
5. Wait for the cron to fire at the scheduled time. The first real fire is the final test.

## What to do when something breaks

- **No post arrived.** Check the logs for `Schedule fired` then `Failed to post`. The most common cause is the bot is not an admin in the channel or "Post messages" is off.
- **403 from Telegram.** Same answer: admin rights.
- **400 "message is too long".** A question exceeded 4096 chars. Run `pnpm audit-questions`; if it does not catch it, trim the scenario or schema.
- **Wrong question for today.** The picker is deterministic per date and pool length. Adding a new question shifts the cycle. That is expected.

## Backups

There is nothing to back up. The repo is the truth. Pin the welcome once and forget it.
